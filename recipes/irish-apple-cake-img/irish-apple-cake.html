  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
    <p>For the streusel, combine flour, sugar, oats, salt, and cinnamon in a bowl. Using a fork or pastry cutter, cut butter into the mixture until it is fully incorporated and has the texture of coarse bread crumbs, about 2 minutes. Chill in the refrigerator until ready to use. </p>

    <li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>

    <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
    <p>For the cake, grease a 9-inch round cake pan with cooking spray. Combine butter, sugar, and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Beat at medium speed, until lightened in color and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, on low speed, just until blended. Beat in vanilla extract.</p>

    <li><h3>Step 4</h3></li>
    <p>Combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl. Add flour mixture to butter-egg mixture and beat on low speed until fully incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Add milk and beat on low speed until combined, about 45 seconds.</p>

    <li><h3>Step 5</h3></li>
    <p>Spread cake batter evenly in the prepared pan.</p>

    <li><h3>Step 8</h3></li>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and streusel is golden brown and crisp, 40 to 50 minutes. Let cake cool in pan on a wire rack 10 minutes. Remove from pan to wire rack and let cool completely, 30 to 45 minutes.</p>
